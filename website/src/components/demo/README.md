# Artintel How It Works Component

This component showcases a three-step process for implementing AI with Artintel:

## Implementation Details

1. **Component Structure**
   - Uses the same layout and animation system as the original HowItWorks component
   - Maintains the staggered animation effects and visual styling
   - Adapts content specifically for Artintel's AI platform

2. **Three-Step Process**
   - **Step 1: Model Discovery & Selection** - Helps users find the perfect AI model for their use case
   - **Step 2: Fine-Tune & Customize** - Enables users to tailor models to their specific domain
   - **Step 3: Deploy & Scale** - Provides tools for seamless deployment and scaling

3. **Custom Visual Assets**
   - Created new custom SVGs tailored specifically for Artintel's workflow:
     - `/images/artintel/model-selection.svg` - Illustrates the model selection process with filter/selection elements
     - `/images/artintel/fine-tune.svg` - Shows data and model customization with parameter adjustments
     - `/images/artintel/deploy-scale.svg` - Depicts deployment hub with connected scaling devices and cloud elements

## SVG Design Elements

The custom SVGs maintain the visual style of the original components while incorporating specific elements for Artintel:

1. **Model Selection SVG**
   - Grid of model options with selection indicators
   - Filter and sorting capabilities represented visually
   - Model comparison elements with checkmarks

2. **Fine-Tune SVG**
   - Data connection visualization
   - Parameter adjustment sliders
   - Dotted connection lines showing workflow
   - Database to model transformation flow

3. **Deploy & Scale SVG**
   - Central deployment hub with radiating connections
   - Multiple device representations (mobile, web, etc.)
   - Cloud deployment visualization
   - API endpoints and scaling indicators

## Viewing the Demo
Navigate to `/demo/artintel-how-it-works` to see this component in action.

## Key Features
- Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 3 columns on desktop)
- Subtle gradient backgrounds that alternate direction
- Sequential numbered steps with cyan accent circles
- Animated entrance for each element to guide user attention
- Custom SVGs that highlight Artintel's specific AI implementation process

This implementation highlights Artintel's streamlined approach to making AI accessible to teams without deep machine learning expertise.
