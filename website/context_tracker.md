## Content Rules and Guidelines

1. **SLM vs LLM Content Separation**: 
   - SLM pages should only discuss Small Language Models
   - LLM pages should only discuss Large Language Models
   - Only the comparison page should directly compare both types

2. **Consistency in Terminology**:
   - "Small Language Models (SLMs)" - for models with parameters ranging from millions to a few billion
   - "Large Language Models (LLMs)" - for models with billions to hundreds of billions of parameters

3. **Audience Focus**:
   - Technical content should be accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
   - Focus on practical applications and business value, not just technical specifications
