# Fine-Tuning Hub

The Fine-Tuning Hub is a comprehensive feature of the Artintel platform that allows users to create, manage, and monitor custom fine-tuned models based on ArtIntel's foundation models.

## Overview

Fine-tuning allows you to adapt ArtIntel's pre-trained models to your specific use cases by training them on your own datasets. This process enhances the model's performance on domain-specific tasks while requiring significantly less data and computational resources than training a model from scratch.

## Key Features

- **Create Training Jobs**: Set up fine-tuning jobs with customizable parameters
- **Monitor Progress**: Track training metrics and resource usage in real-time
- **Resource Management**: View and manage GPU allocations and quotas
- **Advanced Configuration**: Access to LoRA parameters, optimizer settings, and distributed training options
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with the Model Catalog and Data Integration components

## Components

The Fine-Tuning Hub consists of the following key components:

1. **FineTuningHub (Main Page)**: The central dashboard for managing fine-tuning jobs
2. **CreateJobModal**: Interface for creating new fine-tuning jobs with advanced configuration options
3. **ResourceMonitor**: Displays GPU usage, active jobs, and resource quotas
4. **JobDetailPage**: Detailed view of a specific fine-tuning job with metrics and logs

## API Integration

The Fine-Tuning Hub integrates with the following APIs:

- **Fine-Tuning API**: For managing training jobs and resources
- **Model API**: To access base models for fine-tuning
- **Dataset API**: To select datasets for training

## Usage

### Creating a Fine-Tuning Job

1. Navigate to the Fine-Tuning Hub
2. Click "New Training Job"
3. Fill in the basic information (name, etc.)
4. Select a base model from the Model Catalog
5. Select a dataset from the Data Integration section
6. Configure training parameters (or use defaults)
7. Set resource requirements
8. Submit the job

### Monitoring Jobs

The main dashboard displays all your fine-tuning jobs with their current status. For each job, you can:

- View training progress and metrics
- Access detailed logs
- Stop or delete jobs
- Deploy completed models to the Model Catalog

## Best Practices

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and cleaned before fine-tuning
2. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Start with recommended defaults and adjust based on validation metrics
3. **Resource Allocation**: Choose appropriate GPU resources based on model size and dataset complexity
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly check training progress to detect issues early
5. **Evaluation**: Thoroughly test fine-tuned models before deployment

## Technical Implementation

The Fine-Tuning Hub is built using:

- **React**: For the user interface components
- **Next.js**: For routing and server-side rendering
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with a consistent design system
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions

## Development

To extend or modify the Fine-Tuning Hub:

1. The main components are located in `src/components/fine-tuning/`
2. API interfaces and functions are in `src/dashboard-api/fine-tuning-api.ts`
3. API documentation is available in `src/dashboard-api/fine-tuning-api.md`
4. The main page is in `src/app/dashboard/fine-tuning/page.tsx`

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Fine-Tuning Hub include:

- **Experiment Tracking**: Compare multiple fine-tuning runs with different parameters
- **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization**: Suggest optimal parameters based on your data
- **Model Evaluation**: Built-in evaluation tools for fine-tuned models
- **Collaborative Features**: Share fine-tuning jobs and results with team members
- **Custom Training Recipes**: Save and reuse successful fine-tuning configurations
