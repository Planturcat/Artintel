# Git Deployment Steps for Artintel

This document outlines the steps taken to push the Artintel codebase (consisting of two projects: mash-agent and website) to GitHub.

## Project Structure
The repository contains two main projects:
- **mash-agent**: A Next.js application for AI agent functionality
- **website**: A Next.js website for the Artintel platform

Both projects have their own `.gitignore` files to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
- Confirmed the repository structure with two main projects
- Verified that both projects have proper `.gitignore` files
- Confirmed we're using a single git repository at the root level

### 2. Staging Changes
```bash
git add .
```
This command staged all new files from both projects for commit.

### 3. Committing Changes
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add complete codebase for mash-agent and website projects"
```
This created a commit with all the staged changes and a descriptive message.

### 4. Pushing to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
This pushed the committed changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository.

### 5. Verification
```bash
git status
```
Verified that there were no pending changes and everything was pushed successfully.

## Repository Information
- GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/Planturcat/Artintel](https://github.com/Planturcat/Artintel)
- Branch: main

## Project Details

### mash-agent
- A Next.js application for AI agents
- Includes components, UI elements, services, and tools
- Contains its own `.gitignore`, `package.json`, and configuration files

### website
- A Next.js website for the Artintel platform
- Includes pages, components, UI elements, and assets
- Contains its own `.gitignore`, `package.json`, and configuration files

## Next Steps
- For future deployments, simply make changes, then:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "descriptive message"
  git push
  ```
- To create separate repositories for each project (if needed), they would need to be extracted and initialized as their own git repositories.
