# Model Pages Reorganization

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to reorganize and improve the model-related pages in the Artintel website. The goal was to create a more structured approach to presenting information about Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs).

## Key Changes

### 1. Unified Model Directory Structure
- All model-related pages are now consolidated under the `/models` directory path
- Organized with a clear hierarchy of pages to improve navigation

### 2. Page-Specific Focus
- **Models Overview** (`/models`): Provides a general introduction and comparison between LLMs and SLMs
- **LLM Models** (`/models/llm`): Focuses specifically on Large Language Models, their benefits, use cases, and hardware requirements
- **SLM Models** (`/models/slm`): Focuses specifically on Small Language Models, their benefits, use cases, and resource efficiency
- **Models Comparison** (`/models/comparison`): Detailed side-by-side comparison of LLMs and SLMs
- **Model Catalog** (`/models/catalog`): Searchable catalog of available models

### 3. Redirects for Legacy Pages
- Created redirects from old page paths to maintain backward compatibility:
  - `/llm-models` → `/models/llm` 
  - `/slm-models` → `/models/slm`

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated `site.md` to reflect the new page structure
- Enhanced the content on each page to be more focused and relevant to its specific topic

### 5. Features Page Enhancement
- Added a dedicated section about model types (LLMs and SLMs) to the features page
- Included clear comparisons and use cases for each model type
- Added links to relevant model pages for more detailed information

## Benefits of This Reorganization

1. **Improved User Experience**: Clearer navigation path for users interested in learning about different model types
2. **Content Focus**: Each page now has a specific focus, avoiding overlap and confusion
3. **Better SEO**: More structured content organization improves search engine optimization
4. **Streamlined Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update content with a clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more detailed model comparison tools or interactive visualizations
2. Enhance the model catalog with filtering capabilities
3. Add more specific use cases and benchmarks for each model type
4. Consider adding a model selection wizard to help users choose the right model for their needs
